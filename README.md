# Hugo HTML5 UP Arcana

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) port of the
[Arcana template](https://html5up.net/arcana) from
[HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).
Check out the [live demo](https://sec.gd/hugo/themes/arcana/).

## Configuration
See the exampleSite folder. The elements on the homepage are defined in
`data/homepage.yml`, where you can choose which appear and configure them.
The mostly-empty `_index.md` files are required for marking of the active menu
item to work correctly.

## Contributing
Pull requests welcome! This is my first Hugo theme, and I expect there are some
things I've done sub-optimally.

## Thanks
I borrowed a good amount of structure and useful bits from
[hugo-html5up-alpha](https://github.com/dewittn/hugo-html5up-alpha)
